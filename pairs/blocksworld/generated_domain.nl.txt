The content describes a planning problem in the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. 

**Domain:** The domain is "blocksworld-4ops," which focuses on actions related to stacking and unstacking blocks.

**Objects:** The objects in this domain are blocks, although specific block names are not provided in the problem statement.

**Initial State:** The initial state would include various predicates that describe the arrangement of blocks, such as which blocks are on the table, which blocks are clear (not covered by another block), and whether the hand is empty or holding a block.

**Goal:** The goal is to achieve a specific arrangement of blocks, which is not explicitly stated in the problem but would involve certain blocks being stacked or placed on the table in a desired configuration.

**Numeric Constraints:** There are no numeric constraints mentioned in the problem. The actions are defined with logical preconditions and effects rather than numerical limits.

The actions available in this domain include picking up a block, putting it down, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another. Each action has specific conditions that must be met to be executed and results that change the state of the blocks and the hand.
