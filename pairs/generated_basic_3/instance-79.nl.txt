The problem is defined in the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. The objects in this scenario are three blocks: a, b, and c. 

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block b is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The goal of the problem is to have block a placed on top of block c. There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
