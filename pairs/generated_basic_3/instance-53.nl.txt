The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain. It involves three objects: blocks a, b, and c. 

The initial state includes:
- The hand is empty.
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block c is also on the table.
- Block b is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block c is clear (nothing is on top of it).

The goal is to have block a placed on top of block b. There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
