The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. The objects in this scenario are three blocks: a, b, and c.

The initial state specifies the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block b is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block c is also clear.

The goal of the problem is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block a must be on top of block b.
- Block b must be on top of block c.

There are no numeric constraints mentioned in this problem.
