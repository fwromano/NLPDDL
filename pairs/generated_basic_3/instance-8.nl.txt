The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain. It involves three objects: blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 

The initial state indicates that the hand is empty, all blocks are on the table, and each block is clear (meaning no other block is on top of them). 

The goal of the problem is to have block 'a' placed on top of block 'c'. There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
