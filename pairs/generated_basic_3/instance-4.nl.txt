The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain. It involves three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'. 

In the initial state, the following conditions are present:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'c'.
- Block 'c' is on the table.
- Block 'a' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The goal of the problem is to have block 'b' placed on top of block 'a'. There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
