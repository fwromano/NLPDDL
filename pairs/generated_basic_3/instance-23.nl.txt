The problem is defined in the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. The objects in this scenario are three blocks: a, b, and c.

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block a is on top of block b.
- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

The goal of the problem is to have block c placed on top of block b.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
