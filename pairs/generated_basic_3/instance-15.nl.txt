The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. There are three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'.

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'a' is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block 'c' is clear (nothing is on top of it).

The goal of the problem is to have block 'a' placed on top of block 'b'.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
