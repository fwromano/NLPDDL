The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. There are three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'. 

The initial state includes:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block 'a' must be on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' must be on top of block 'a'.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
