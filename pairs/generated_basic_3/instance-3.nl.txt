The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. There are three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'.

The initial state includes:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'c'.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'b' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block 'b' must be placed on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'c' must be placed on top of block 'b'.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
