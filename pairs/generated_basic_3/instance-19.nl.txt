The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. The objects in this scenario are three blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'b' is on the table.
- Block 'c' is also on the table.
- Block 'a' is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block 'c' is clear as well.

The goal of the problem is to achieve two conditions:
1. Block 'a' must be placed on top of block 'c'.
2. Block 'b' must be placed on top of block 'a'.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
