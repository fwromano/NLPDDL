The problem is defined in the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. There are three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'. 

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'b' is on the table.
- Block 'c' is also on the table.
- Block 'a' is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block 'c' is clear as well.

The goal of the problem is to have block 'b' placed on top of block 'c'. There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
