The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain, which involves manipulating blocks. There are three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'. 

In the initial state, the following conditions are true:
- The hand is empty.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is on the table.
- Block 'c' is on the table.
- Block 'a' is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block 'b' is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block 'c' is clear (nothing is on top of it).

The goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block 'a' must be placed on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'b' must be placed on top of block 'c'.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
