The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain. It involves three objects: blocks a, b, and c. 

The initial state includes the following conditions:
- The hand is empty.
- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is also on the table.
- Block a is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block b is clear.

The goal is to achieve two conditions:
1. Block a must be on top of block b.
2. Block b must be on top of block c.

There are no numeric constraints specified in this problem.
