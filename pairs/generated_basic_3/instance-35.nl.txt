The problem is defined within the "blocksworld-4ops" domain. It involves three objects: blocks a, b, and c. 

The initial state specifies that the hand is empty, block a is on the table, block b is on top of block a, block c is on top of block b, and block c is clear (meaning nothing is on top of it).

The goal is to achieve two conditions: block a must be placed on top of block c, and block b must remain on top of block a. 

There are no numeric constraints mentioned in this problem.
